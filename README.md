# QTM 350: Data Science Computing – Assignment 05: Literate Programming with Quarto

**Due:** 26 February 2025

## Overview

This repository contains my assignment for QTM 350. In this project, I analyzed a sample of the World Development Indicators (2022) dataset (14 variables, 217 rows) using Quarto. The assignment demonstrates proficiency in literate programming by producing reproducible documents in multiple formats (HTML, PDF) and a Reveal.js presentation that incorporates the analysis, visualizations, and key statistics.

## Contents

- **report.qmd** – Quarto file containing the full data analysis report with code, results, visualizations (e.g., bar chart and scatter plot), and a well-formatted table of key statistics.
- **slides.qmd** – Quarto file configured for a Reveal.js presentation. This presentation includes a title slide, content slides integrating the analysis and visualizations, and a concluding slide. The slides also feature a custom theme and transition effects.
- **report.html** – Rendered HTML version of the analysis report.
- **report.pdf** – Rendered PDF version of the analysis report.
- **slides.html** – Rendered HTML version of the presentation.
- **bibliography.bib** – BibTeX file containing references to at least two sources related to the analysis.
- All associated assets (e.g., images such as `bar_chart.png` and `scatter_plot.png`) are included.

## Published Pages

The HTML versions of the report and presentation have been published using GitHub Pages:

- **HTML Report:** [https://Kei-Nie.github.io/wdi-analysis/report.html](https://Kei-Nie.github.io/wdi-analysis/report.html)
- **Presentation:** [https://Kei-Nie.github.io/wdi-analysis/slides.html](https://Kei-Nie.github.io/wdi-analysis/slides.html)

## Additional Features

- **Interactive Dashboard (Bonus):** An interactive dashboard was developed using Quarto's dashboard features, incorporating dynamic filters for exploring the data.
- **Automated Rendering (Bonus):** The project is set up with GitHub Actions to automatically render the Quarto documents upon each push, ensuring that the latest versions of the report and slides are always available.
